                Programming is a cardinal element in the computer science
                stream. The digital world is driven by computer programs. The
                heart of the programs is the code. The computer people are very
                enthusiastic about programming. This aura also attracts people
                from other streams to jam the RAM. For this reason, some of the
                students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
                of Assam Engineering College (AEC) came up with the idea of a
                club—called the Coding Club of AEC.
              </p>
              <p>
                From time to time, this club has been organizing various events.
                The most notable one is the annual coding competition during
                Pyrokinesis. Taking this opportunity, I applaud the efforts of
                the club committee members and also the other members for
                nurturing the club to sustain. As Professor in-charge, I wish
                the Coding Club of AEC may attain an envious height of success
                soon.
